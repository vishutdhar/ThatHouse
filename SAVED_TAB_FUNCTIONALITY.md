# Saved Tab Functionality Report

## Summary of Implementation

I've successfully made all buttons functional in the Saved Properties screen. Here's what has been implemented:

## Functional Buttons List

### 1. **Header Buttons**
- ✅ **Sort Button** - Opens sort modal with options:
  - Price: Low to High
  - Price: High to Low
  - Newest First
  - Recently Saved
- ✅ **Compare Mode Toggle** - Activates compare mode for selecting multiple properties

### 2. **Search & Filter**
- ✅ **Search Bar** - Filters properties by address, city, or state
- ✅ **Clear Search Button** - Appears when search query exists
- ✅ **Filter Chips**:
  - Main "Filters" button opens filter modal
  - Price range chips (Under $300K, $300K-$500K, etc.)
  - Bedroom chips (1+ Beds, 2+ Beds, etc.)
- ✅ **Filter Modal** - Opens with property type filters and clear/apply buttons

### 3. **Property Card Buttons**
- ✅ **Property Card Tap** - Navigate to property details (or select in compare mode)
- ✅ **Heart Button** - Remove from saved properties
- ✅ **Long Press Menu** - Shows quick actions:
  - Add Note
  - Add to Collection
  - Share
  - Compare
  - Remove from Saved

### 4. **Swipe Actions**
- ✅ **Swipe Left** - Reveals share and remove buttons
- ✅ **Share Button** (blue) - Share property via system share sheet
- ✅ **Remove Button** (red) - Remove from saved with undo option

### 5. **Compare Mode**
- ✅ **Property Selection** - Tap properties to select (max 3)
- ✅ **Compare Button** - Appears when 2+ properties selected, navigates to comparison

### 6. **Modals**
- ✅ **Sort Modal** - All sort options functional with visual feedback
- ✅ **Notes Modal** - Add/edit notes for properties
- ✅ **Filter Modal** - Property type filters with clear/apply
- ✅ **Collection Modal** - Assign properties to collections (Favorites, Considering, Scheduled Viewing)

### 7. **Undo Functionality**
- ✅ **Undo Snackbar** - Appears for 5 seconds after removing property
- ✅ **Undo Button** - Restores removed property

### 8. **Empty State**
- ✅ **Start Browsing Button** - Navigates to swipe screen when no saved properties

## Integration Points

### Redux Integration
- ✅ Reads from `savedProperties` and `priorityProperties` arrays in user slice
- ✅ Uses `propertyNotes` and `propertyCollections` from properties slice
- ✅ All state updates properly dispatched to Redux

### Swipe Agent Coordination
- ✅ Properties saved from swipe screen appear in saved tab
- ✅ Priority properties (superlikes) are included in saved properties
- ✅ Collection badges display correctly for categorized properties

### Haptic Feedback
- ✅ Light haptic on most button presses
- ✅ Medium haptic on long press
- ✅ Consistent feedback throughout

## Edge Cases Handled
1. **Empty States** - Shows appropriate message and CTA
2. **Search with No Results** - Properties list updates dynamically
3. **Compare Limit** - Alert shown when trying to select more than 3 properties
4. **Undo Timeout** - Properly clears after 5 seconds or on manual undo

## Code Quality
- All buttons have proper TypeScript types
- Consistent styling using theme colors
- Performance optimized with useMemo for filtered properties
- Proper cleanup of timeouts

## Testing Recommendations

To test the implementation:

1. **Sort Functionality**
   - Tap sort button and try each option
   - Verify properties reorder correctly

2. **Filter & Search**
   - Type in search bar and verify filtering
   - Tap price/bedroom chips and verify filtering
   - Open filter modal and test property type filters

3. **Compare Mode**
   - Toggle compare mode
   - Select 2-3 properties
   - Tap compare button to navigate

4. **Notes & Collections**
   - Long press a property
   - Add a note and verify it saves
   - Add to collection and verify badge appears

5. **Remove & Undo**
   - Swipe left on property or tap heart button
   - Verify undo appears and functions

## Next Steps

The implementation is complete and ready for testing. All buttons are functional with proper state management and user feedback.
